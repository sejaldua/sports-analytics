## Web Scraping Lab: Bayesian Basketball

Scrape data from [www.sports-reference.com](https://sports-reference.com) to inform the variables in Bayes Theorem for an event A and B of your choosing.

$$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|¬A)P(¬A)}$$

A = Team X wins a game  

B = Team X makes more 3-PT shots in the first half, relative to their opponent
