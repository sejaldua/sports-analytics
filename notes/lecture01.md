## Lecture 1: Bayes' Theorem

- 3 sports of focus: football, basketball, baseball
- 3 principles
    - numerically grounded
    - explainable (in English)
        - Chad Bradford
            - sidearm / underhand pitch
            - closer to plate
            - up then down makes batters swing too high
        - Ricky Davis
            - free agent racking up stats as point guard
        - Damian Lillard
            - shoots from way behind the 3-point line
    - actionable
- shot ability vs. shot probability
    - good shooter (high shot ability), bad shots (low shot probability)
    - bad shooter (low shot ability), good shots (high shot probability)

- More information should improve predictive accuracy
    - More information tends to increase predictive confidence faster than it increases predictive accuracy
    - People tend to be biased towards their most recent observations
    - Rare events can be difficult to quantify with sampling data
    - Human bias can both influence and outstrip sampling errors.
- Bayes Theorem (see Nate Silver)
    - $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$ 
      - ASSUMPTION: A & B are independent
      - P(B) = likelihood influence of new evidence
      - P(A) = prior = what we know before we receive new information
      - P(A|B) = posterior 
    - $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(A)P(B|A)+P(¬A)P(B|¬A)}$
